## Why wizardsurvey.fun?

- As a side project, I set out to create a survey website that prioritizes user-friendliness and offers an appealing user interface.
- In my research, I came across findings indicating that traditional survey designs tend to lack engagement.
- I also discovered criticisms regarding online surveys, citing issues such as uninteresting content leading to negative respondent behavior, including speeding through questions, providing random responses, and reduced participant attention.
- These insights inspired me to develop a survey platform that aims to transform the survey-taking experience into an engaging and enjoyable one, all while maintaining an intuitive user interface.
